## Web Development UI Task

We at CredoWeb are always trying to improve the look and feel of our platform and a great UI Developer would help us bring that better experience to the end user.

Your task is to bring to "live" the provided PhotoShop file and create the actual web page based on the design.

### Tips and Help

.. and just a few pointers below for the task:

* HTML5 and CSS3 are a must!
* Focus on how well is implemented the grid system, alignment of elements and style of code
* Box items shouldn't be implemented as an images in OUR SERVICES section (Every parts must be separated by each other -Titles, Slogans, Buttons, etc.)
* Social buttons (see footer section) must be coresponding with the social global colors on their hovering
* Responsive version is a priority - Mobile first! There's no a PSD design for that, so feel free to use your imagination :)
* You are free to use pre-compilers such as SASS or LESS
* There's no need to implement the JavaScript functionality (Buttons, Search, etc.) so they can be always visible
* No need to make the icons SVGs - images are just fine

If you feel like you want to show us what you're are really capable of, here is a list of potential enhancements that we have come up with. You can always go the extra mile and do not limit yourself to it if you think of any other possible feature enhancement that you want to include in your submission.

* Create style elements insted of images
* Hovering animations
* Using Flex/Grid system will be considered an advantage
* Improve the speed of the page in terms of the images/content loading
